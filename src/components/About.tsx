          <p>
            I currently study <b>statistics/operations research/data science</b> with a minor in <b>computer science</b> and involvement in the philosophy department. I am interested in ideas that involve solving core issues in the field of education and how HCI impacts it. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Via research, personal projects, and work outside and inside the classroom, I know my way well around major data science packages and have a good hand on full-stack development.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I'm not working with data, you can find me [your hobbies/interests]. I believe in [your philosophy/approach to work/studies].
