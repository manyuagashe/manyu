My website. Constructed in typeScript, deployed on GitHub Pages. 

first attempt at a personal website via artificial intelligence (LLM) assistance. 

This website was build on a frame generated by Lovable's LLM. Lovable is a swedish firm simplifying coding by generating code for whole apps. I did not want to pay for its pro plan to have my apps whole stack be coded by Lovable, so I just made it spin up a basic frontend, built off of it myself with my knowledge of react+typeScript, for this product here. Definitely not a finished product and I will have constant updates. 

just meant to be a little digital portfolio for anyone who wants to know a little more about me.
